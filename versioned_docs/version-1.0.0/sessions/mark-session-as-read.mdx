Mark Session as Read

When an user sends a message then a particular session will have a new messages. If all the messages sent by an end user are viewed by the agent, then you can mark that session as read.

```
Boolean markAsRead = ZohoIM.getInstance(IM_ORG_ID, SERVICE_ORG_ID)
                    .getSessionAPI(USER_ID)
                    .markAsRead(SESSION_ID, LAST_SEEN_MESSAGE_ID);
```
