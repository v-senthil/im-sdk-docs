## WhatsApp phone-number migration:

## WhatsApp phone number migration enables migrating a registered phone number from one WhatsApp Business Account  (WABA) to another. Using this, a business can easily switch their phone number from an active WABA created in other business-service-providers to a new or an existing one created in Zoho.

WhatsApp phone-number migration can be done via Embedded SignUp.

### Conditions & pre-requisites:

1.  The losing WABA (created in other BSP) and the gaining WABA (to be created in Zoho) should be in the same Facebook Business account.
2.  The two-step verification for the migrating phone number should be disabled by the previous BSP. It is the customer's responsibility to contact their previous BSP (losing WABA owner) to disable two-step verification on their phone number.
3.  No conversations or messages will be migrated with the process. Only the display name, quality rating, messaging limits & Official Business Account status will be retained.
4.  Templated messages previously created cannot be used in IM even-though they would be migrated with the approval status. Customers are expected to create new templates for now.
5.  Once the number is migrated, it is recommended to create a WhatsApp channel for the number immediately to avoid any delay in receiving messages.
