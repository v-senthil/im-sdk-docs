IM channels created for integration services such as LINE have its own webhook configured in order to receive incoming events .Each channel is associated with a bot channel created in LINE . In order to get the configured webhook URL of the channel one needs to pass the channelId and the  associated  IMintegrationService as parameters .

NOTE : The API is applicable only for TELEGRAM and LINE channels .

```
//IntegrationService
 IMIntegrationServices integerationService  =  IMIntegrationServices.LINE;
//IntegrationCustomAPIImpl
IntegrationCustomAPI  integrationCustomAPIImpl  =ZohoIM.getInstance(IM_ORG_ID, SERVICE_ORG_ID).getIntegrationCustomAPI(USER_ID);
//webhookInfoResponse
IMBasicObject  webhookResponse  = integrationCustomAPIImpl.getWebhookInfo(integrationService ,CHANNEL_ID);
```

```
Response : {
    "data":{
        "isActive"  : "false",
        "webhookURL":      "https://af6b1b9c.ngrok.io/integrations/line/incomingCallback.do?ECTX=8ce93*****5e"
          },
    "kind": "single.json"
       }
```

The status isActive indicates whether the webhook is active or not. If true, it means the webhook is active and events will be pushed to the channel.
