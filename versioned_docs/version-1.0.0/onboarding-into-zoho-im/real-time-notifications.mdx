Zoho Instant Messaging is nothing without real time notifications of messages and statuses. Zoho IM will create a dedicated Kafka topic and will be shared to the service teams. Teams have to make a consumer up for listening and share its details to the IM team to map the topic to the consumer. All events, including messages are written into that topic.

The consumed notifications can be processed:

1.  Through the IM SDK by implementing  com.zoho.im.client.api.schema.IMClientAPIHandler. The implemented class will be called on each event and use IMEventMeta to know about organization details. Teams can implement com.zoho.im.client.api.schema.IMClientAPIHandler - interface and provide the implemented class name in im.properties file.
2.  By reading directly from the topic that IM have created.
