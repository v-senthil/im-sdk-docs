1.  Zoho Instant Messaging doesn't have separate licensing yet as we are a service now and not a product.
2.  Implementing Zoho Services can decide on that front.
3.  However, for sending messages to external services that require money (WhatsApp), Zoho Instant Messaging has Add-Ons that customers can opt-for.

The Above Diagram shows the types of Payment sources available and their support in ZohoIM

### Payments:

1.  Platforms like WhatsApp charge the Outgoing Messages being sent. In future, Some other platforms too might charge for Messages/any other actions.
2.  To address such cases, Zoho Instant Messaging maintains a wallet which can be charged through Add-On's which are tagged along with Respective Integrating ZohoService.
3.  If ZohoCRM is integrates with Zoho Instant Messaging, a new Add-On will be created and mapped to ZohoCRM. The CRM team has to implement the Add-On Purchase inside the Product.
4.  The Wallet will have Credits, and for each Message, a certain amount will be deducted from the Credits.

Example: Customer can buy 4 Credits. And, for each Outgoing

message a flat 0.0125 will be deducted. The new balance would be

3.9875. Customer can buy Credits as and when required.

5.  However, Zoho Instant Messaging will not have any restrictions on the number of Channels Created. Respective Service Teams can handle that.

### Bundle Services:

1.  If the Service is associated to any Bundle Services(CrmPlus/ZohoOne etc) the Add-On will be defined at Bundle level.
2.  Implementing teams should convey whether their Product is associated with any Bundle while Approaching for Integration.
3.  Customer can use multiple products in Bundle Services, which will be mapped to only one Zoho IM Organization. So, credits will also be unified to that one organization.

### Implementation gist

1.  AddonId request will be initiated by IM team and it will be shared once configured at store's end.
2.  To enable purchase of IMCredit add-on from Store, custom add-on enabling for IMCredits is expected in response to getServiceSubscriptionInfo() on Store's request .  [Ref.](/portal/zohocorp/manual/im-developers-corner/article/callback-and-propagation#_Toczprdf5fie9if)
3.  [Check here](/portal/zohocorp/team/zohoim/manual/sdk-reference/article/payment-widget) for implementing the in-product widget to purchase credits.
4.  In both the above cases, callbacks from the Store will be received by Service teams, and propagation to IM needs to be handled by Service teams.  [Check here](/portal/zohocorp/team/zohoim/manual/im-developers-corner/article/callback-and-propagation) for more details.
5.  For credit auto-renewal,  IM provides the API and has its limitations. Service teams are expected to build their own form to get in line with the product's UI and requirement. [Check here](/portal/zohocorp/team/zohoim/manual/sdk-reference/article/auto-renewal) for more details.
6.  Credit balances and deductions will be handled by IM.
