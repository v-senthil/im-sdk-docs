Why WhatsApp cannot be tested in csez setup?

Testing WhatsApp in a csez setup is not feasible due to several dependencies. As a workaround, You can test telegram in csez. The APIs and the flow of incoming and outgoing messages are similar between Telegram and WhatsApp. The main differences lie in some parameters during channel configuration.

WhatApp dependencies in csez:

1.  Embedded signup completion
2.  WABA configuration
3.  WhatsApp webhook configuration
4.  Template approval
5.  Whatsapp API calls

We are currently exploring a workaround to conduct basic WhatsApp testing within the csez setup, but this process may require some time. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
