It is highly recommended to ensure that there aren't any existing Organizations present before creating a new one by getting all Organizations from IM each time. While using the SDK, this API uses Current Ticket.

Creating an IM Organization requires:

1.  IM Organization name in String (should be unique)
2.  Service Org ID or AppAccount ID of the invoking service
3.  Zoho User ZUID

```
String IM_ORGANIZATION_NAME = "ZOHO_DESK_17191691";            // some services follow a pattern for Org Name - {ServiceName}_{ServiceOrgId}

//Construct IMOrganization builder
IMOrganization imOrgBuilder = new IMOrganization.Builder(IM_ORGANIZATION_NAME).build();

//Invoke IM Organization creation API
IMOrganization createdOrganization = ZohoIM.getInstance(null, SERVICE_ORG_ID)
        .getOrganizationAPI(USER_ID)
        .createOrganization(imOrgBuilder);
```
