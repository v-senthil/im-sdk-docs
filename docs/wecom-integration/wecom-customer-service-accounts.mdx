What is Wechat Customer Service Account?

[Customer Service Account](https://developer.work.weixin.qq.com/document/path/94683) - A Customer Service Account is a channel that allows WeCom enterprises to have conversations with WeChat customers. Currently, a company can add up to 5,000 Customer Service Accounts. These accounts can be created either through the WeCom organization’s Admin Panel or via the WeCom API.

We have two apis of Customer Service Account - Get Customer Service Account List and Create Customer Service Account.

                    new IMWeComCustomerServiceAccount.IMWeComCustomerServiceAccountQuery().weComCorpId(weComCorpId);
            query.range(offset, limit);
            // Execute query
            IMEntityList&lt;IMWeComCustomerServiceAccount&gt; accounts =
                    ZohoIM.getInstance(IM_ORG_ID, SERVICE_ORG_ID).getIntegrationCustomAPI(USER_ID).getWeComCustomerServiceAccounts(query);

            // Print account details
            for (IMWeComCustomerServiceAccount account : accounts.getEntities()) {
                System.out.println("Account: " + account.getAccountName());
